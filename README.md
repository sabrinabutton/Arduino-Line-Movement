# Arduino-Line-Movement

## How it Works
#####This program allows for an arduino to move along a black line on a white sheet using light sensors. 
Five light sensors are attatched to the front of the robot which detect the location of the line. If the middle light sensor detects the line, the robot goes forward. If the sensors on the left or right of the center sensor detect the line, the robot will turn and adjust in order to center itself on the line. If the far right or far left sensor detect the line, the robot will turn more drastically in order to center itself, then continue forward once centered.
